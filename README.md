# FUNDAMENTALS-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS

<p>G00364639</p>
<p>This repository is used for the project given during the FUNDAMENTALS-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from ATU.</p>

<p>I have created Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code, & I have added added comments to explain work, along with references<br>

<p>For this markup sheet, I used the following websites as guides.<br>

# Introduction #
<p>For this module I created two notebooks.</p>

<p>
<li>tasks.ipynb, which contains all the work relating to tasks section</li>
<li>project.ipynb, which contains all the work relating to project section</li>
</p>

# How to run program #
<ol>
<li> My github repository is @ <a href="#">https://github.com/dectan/FUNDAMENTALS-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS</a></li>
<li> My github Ripository is called "FUNDAMENTALS-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS</li>
<li> This ripository contains a .gitignore file, 2 *  Jupyter notebooks, and a readme file. </li>   
<li> My Jupyter notebooks are called "project.ipynb" and "tasks.ipynb"</li> 
<li> There are no additional files required to run program as dataset is loaded from seaborn</a></li>
<li> Libraries that need to be imported are contained in first cell of Jupyter notebook </li> 
<li> *Run all*</li> 
</ol>

# Imported Libraries #

<ol>
<li>import numpy as np</li>
<p> NumPy is short for "Numerical Python". It allows for matematical and logical operations on arrays efficiently. NumPy also enables user to reshape,slice ,stack and join arrays.</p>
<li>import pandas as pd</li>
<p>Pandas is an open source Python library that provides high performance data manipulation tools and analysis tools. It also allows for reading and writing from various file formats, such as .csv. Pandas has functions for analyzing, cleaning , exploring and manipulating data</p>
<li>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</li>
<p>Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python. It is open source. Using Mathplotlib, different types of plots can be created, such as scatter plots, histograms,box plots etc.</p>
<li>import seaborn as sns</li>
<p>Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.It is designed to work well with dataframes from Pandas
<li>from scipy.stats import dweibull</li>
<p> a python function that from scipy.stats that generates random numbers usinfg double weibull distribution</p>
